# Reed_Improved_Grade_Tracker

A Course-Specific, Weighted GPA Calculator and Tracker

This application is built using Python 3 to provide students with a coursespecific tool for calculating weighted grade point averages (GPAs) and managing grade data persistently. It is designed to mimic real world reporting where different assignement types (Quizzes, Projects, Exams) carry different percentage weights for the final score.
